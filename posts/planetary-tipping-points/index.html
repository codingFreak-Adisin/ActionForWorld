                <h4>"The beauty of the unexpected lies within the surprise of the momentum,
                    not only at its tipping point, but also within all the moments waiting.”

                    <p>People often get along with quotes which convey life lessons and teach them a lot but they forget to understand the words and their actual meanings in it. In the above quote you must have understood about the turning points in life where you may tip and fall; which was described as 'Tipping Point', but do you really know what a 'Tipping Point' is? Do you really care to know about? Do you have any idea of the impact it is creating on the world?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>TIPPING POINTS</b> - Also referred as Planetary Tipping Boundaries sometimes
                        The increase in global average temperature is being felt all throughout the planet, from melting glaciers, increasing floods and worsening droughts to disappearing Arctic sea ice and record breaking heat waves. These effects have been representing progressive changes brought on by a steadily warming environment. The dramatical and permanent changes are contributing to global warming.These are known as 'planetary boundaries' or climate 'tipping points'.
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>CAN WE PREDICT THESE TIPPING POINT?
                        WHAT LEADING SCIENTISTS SAY?
                        WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO?
                    </h4>
                    <p>Tipping points seem to be scary, they don’t take away human agency over the problem of climate change. We may not be able to exactly predict when some of these tipping points will occur, but what we can do - control our actions and take ownership of our emissions. Climate action, swift changes in public opinion, technology and policy, could work to rapidly reduce emissions and prevent the worst effects of climate change- so long as governments get moving on their climate plans.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As the world continues to warm, some call for urgent global action to avert an "existential threat" to civilization. We may be about to pass or may already have passed tipping points in the Earths climate, according to a group of leading scientists. However, they also conclude that "there are still many misconceptions that cloud the controversy surrounding planetary-scale tipping points".</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Researchers need to improve their understanding of these observed changes in major ecosystems, as well as where future tipping points might lie. Existing carbon stores and potential releases of CO2 and methane need better quantification</p>

                        <li>●	Questions arises when we assume that technology can keep solving problems regardless of the nature of the problem</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>The restorative power of our planet “Earth”, has remained broadly same throughout the years; the only thing which changes is “Power of balance”. Throughout in our history, they treated earth as a big & limitless world compared to everything, we could throw at it & harm we can cause to its climate. In This Modern Era the power of above-mentioned line is shifted, every single item we throw on it definitely would come back to bite us. In past few years we are confronting it in form of “Climate change”. So in order to not keep the FUTURE same as the PAST, we need to come together and work harder, we still have time to turn things around by changing our action.</p>
