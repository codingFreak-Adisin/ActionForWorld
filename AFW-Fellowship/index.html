        <h3>AFW Fellowship</h3>
        <p>What does the fellowship entail? <br> Sessions 1-8: Fellows will attend biweekly 1.5-hour sessions on Google Meet, covering a wide range of topics related to climate change and environmental issues. Some topics include an introduction to climate change, the science behind the crisis, and the water crisis. These sessions will be led by our fellowship facilitators at Action, along with guest speakers such as activists, CEOs, and industry experts. Fellows will also take part in interactive activities like debates, discussions, and workshops to deepen their understanding.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sessions 9-12: These sessions focus on leadership and entrepreneurship. Fellows will develop essential skills through biweekly 1.5-hour workshops with world leaders and experts. They will learn about initiative planning, entrepreneurship, and how to inspire others to take action. By the end of this phase, fellows will have a solid foundation to start planning their own initiatives.
            <br>
            <br>
            Final 1 Month: Fellows will put their knowledge into action by launching an initiative of their choice. They will apply everything theyâ€™ve learned throughout the fellowship, with guidance and support from their own Action mentor.</p>

                <p class="text">According to me, the best thing about the fellowship was the fact that I learnt about so much going on and around the world that i had absolutely no idea about. The sessions were very informative and I definitely learned a lot through the fellowship. I had also proposed an idea to my school regarding a club like group which helps promote a sustainable living and it's most likely about to get launched ðŸ˜€</p>

                <p class="text">The fellowship itself was really awesome with having a diversity in mentors and fellows. The stage gave us an opportunity to think and share our thoughts on different topics.
                    I particularly liked the guest lectures.
                    I, as a participant, was able to make connections, learn new things and was able to reflect it in my community.</p>

                <p class="text">The fellowship was a wonderful experience. Every session was much informative and interactive. All the mentors were amazing. The program taught me how we all as an individuals can work to solve environment crisis.  My favorite  part was the leadership training.

                <p class="text">The session was awesome and informative. Some of the basic fundamental doubts were all cleared after attending. One thing I would like to highlight is about the guest sessions, the organisation should include frequent guest invitees because of the interaction and experience area of different regions they give during the sessions. People will get to know about the stages of growth happening in different parts of the world.</p>
