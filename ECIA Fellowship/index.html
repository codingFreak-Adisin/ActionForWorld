        <h3>ECIA Fellowship Asia/Australia</h3>
        <p>What does the fellowship entail? <br> Sessions 1-8: fellows will attend biweekly, 2 hour sessions via zoom where we will be discussing an array of topics surrounding the key theme of environmentalism. Examples of topics include circular economies, inequalities within the climate crisis, and how to be a successful activist. These sessions will be led by the ACTION team, in addition to outside speakers from other organizations and/or businesses; including many interactive activities, such as debates, discussions, workshops and more!
            <br>
            <br>
            Sessions 9-12: focusses on leadership. These 2 hour biweekly sessions will include personal workshops with world leaders, the basics of initiative planning, entrepreneurial skills, and how to engage others with your passions. This will create a strong foundation for our fellows, as they begin to brainstorm and plan their initiative. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Final 2 Months: students will run an initiative of their choosing using all of the skills they've learned in this fellowship, in addition to assistance from their own ACTION mentor</p>

                <p class="text">The fellowship was a great couse. It was my first time attending something like fellowship and at first I was surprised to meet people like me who want to change the future with innovative ideas and had great love towards the mother earth. This was the best thing about fellowship that young minds like me interacted with each other with mentors who have been working for it from long.</p>

                    I particularly liked the guest lectures.
                    I, as a participant, was able to make connections, learn new things and was able to reflect it in my community.</p>
